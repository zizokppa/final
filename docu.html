        <h2>Introduction for the Video</h2>
     <p>

        In the year 2024, a young woman receives a mysterious camcorder from the future. As she powers it on, she is shocked to see a recording of her own murder, a chilling scene from 2035. The only clue she has is the voice from the recording, urging her to make a phone call—a call that connects her to the killer’s number.
        
        What begins as a desperate attempt to uncover the truth spirals into a haunting realization: the voice, the killer, and the victim are all the same person. The girl finds herself entangled in a loop where time becomes a circle, and the boundaries between her past, present, and future dissolve.
        
        As she confronts the inevitable, she begins to understand the inescapable truth of her existence: she has always been her own observer, her own savior, and her own demise.</p>
        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>
            For my project， I am focusing on the paradox that in my film time is not a linear existence,
            how does future, present, and past exist. The central theme of the film revolves around the
            paradox that time is not a linear existence. The film explores how the future, present, and past
            coexist simultaneously and how this impacts the protagonist's understanding of her own
            existence. Each part of the film addresses a different aspect of this paradox, leading to a final
            realization of the protagonist’s dispersed existence.
            I divided my outline into three parts. and planning each part 2-3 scenes  </p>
        
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
           During the editing process, I decided to continue the 'still image series' from 'City as System' Project. Not only an extend of the project but also I think it removed a lot of unwanted distractions and some shaky camera movements in the video. 
           And it gradually turned into this final story version rather than the very initial idea.
